# Thoughts on Mapping a Mind: Anthropic Paper

I recently read a post by the folks at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) titled [Mapping a Mind](https://www.anthropic.com/news/mapping-mind-language-model). One thing that popped out was the "Sycophancy Feature" when dialed up all the way it will turn the model into a Sycophant. I thought that was a funny and interesting feature to have. I wonder if it's possible to have a model that can be turned into a "Devil's Advocate" or a "Contrarian" by dialing up a feature. I think it would be interesting to see how the model would behave in those scenarios.
